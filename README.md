Easter_Eggs : If we enter a passcode on the load screen, it shows something!
play Autumn wind written by me when you accomplish 

Roll Credits at the end, everything by us

Play songs in battle (Maybe from Undertale)


Meeting 2:

- Start and End are determined 
The path through them is random
maybe 1/2 random encounters 
-> A, B, C, D (2 or 3 or maybe 4 or 5 locations)

A: 
2--8
Once encountered monster, can't fight again

12 "Screens" dialouge (choices)
screen 1, & 6 


-> difeerent monsters in each location
- items are random as well

Idea 1
