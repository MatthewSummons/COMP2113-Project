Darkness and a chilling Cold.

As you unseal your near-frozen eyelids, a perplexing scene beholds you.
You're on your back, gazing up to a gray sky, barely visible.
There's whiteness everywhere and it's cold. You're amidst what seems to be the start of
a blizzard. 

As the energy in your body returns, you feel the cold from the melting ice under you seep into your legs
through your jeans. You can barely feel your feet and hands.

It's so cold.
So Cold.

"What the ..."

"I need to search for warmth. I'm not just going to die like this."

"What's happening?!"

"Doesn't matter! I need to look for something to regain my heat", you mutter as you slowly scamper up.

As you stand up, you notice that you're in a clearning. The trees, hardly noticeable under the heavy snow,
surround you. You're stood amidst a forest. With nowhere to-- ... 

As turn around, you notice a trail of thick, black smoke in the sky coming from inside the forest
