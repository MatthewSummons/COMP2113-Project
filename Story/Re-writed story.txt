Prologue:


The girl's father died. Her name was Hera. She had a loyal husky friend named Lucky. The girl mourned day and night for her father. Suddenly out of the darkness emerged a creature that called itself the spirit of Frost namely Moroz. The Spirit of Frost appears to all the dead. Suddenly, the spirit spoke to the girl:


* Do you want your father to be resurrected?
* Yes. But that's impossible.
* Possible. But for this, you need magic crystals that will revive your father. Parts of these crystals are held by Baba Yaga, Koshchei the Immortal, Zmey Gorynych and the Snow Queen. If you manage to collect these crystals, you can make a magic flower out of them. This flower is unusual, it contains the magical power of all its owners. The owner of this flower can translate all conceivable and inconceivable desires into reality. I will help you take possession of these crystals.

Act 1: Baba Yaga.


The spirit accompanies the girl to Baba Yaga and disappears.


Seeing the girl, Baba Yaga was delighted and thought to herself, “Today I will not be left hungry.” So she began to prepare the ingredients for the upcoming dinner. She kindled a fire, put water in the cauldron, and spoke to the girl:


* Come in, girl, you must be hungry from a long journey. I have some food waiting for you.


Choice:
Go to Baba Yaga:
When the girl approached Baba Yaga, she wanted to put her on the stove and said:


* You must be hungry, there's a baked potato in the oven. Take it.


When the girl reached into the stove, Baba Yaga tried to close the lid of the stove. Then the girl decided to go to the trick:


* I can't reach the cauldron with potatoes. You have long arms, grandma, help me get it.
Then Baba Yaga decided to look into the stove. At that moment, the girl pushed Baba Yaga into the stove with a kindled fire and closed the lid of the stove. Baba Yaga began to scream for help. Then the girl said:


* I'll help you if you give me your crystal.


Baba Yaga had no choice and she agreed.


(first crystal taken)


Don't go:
Baba Yaga puts her behind bars in shackles to starve to death.


Act 2: Koshchei the immortal


With the guidance of the spirit, the girl goes to Koshchei the immortal.


The girl came to Koshchei's castle. He saw her and said:


* You deserve a punishment for barging into my territory without my permission. But I am merciful and fair, therefore I give you a choice so that you choose your fate. Now, who do you want to turn into a statue, zombie or animal? 


Choice:
Become a stone:
Game over


Become a zombie:
Turn into one of Koschei’s obedient followers forever.


Become an animal
* My choice is to become an animal. However, I just don't understand how you do it. As my last wish, show me how you do it yourself.
* Koschei turns into a cat. Lucky grabs the cat and brings it to Hera in his mouth. Koschei pleaded:


* Do not eat me. I will give you my most precious thing: a crystal.


(second crystal taken)


Act 3: Three-headed dragon Gorynych


The girl went to the land of the three-headed dragon Gorynych.


First head:


* We're not going to let you live. You are our prisoner. We will burn you.


Second head:


* But I thought we were going to trample her?


Third head:


* Better that we eat her. I want to eat!


First head:


* Okay, let's not argue. Let the girl choose how she wants to die.


Choice:
Get burned:
End of the game.


Get trampled:
End of the game.


Get eaten:


* Fine, I’ll choose to be eaten. But how are you going to eat me at the same time since there are three of you? Which one of you has sharper teeth, so my death will be quick and painless? Can you all show me your teeth? 


Dragon bows his head down for a better look and the girl jumps on the neck.


A spirit appears and gives Hera a magic sword. She threatens the dragon:


* I won't kill you if you give me your crystal. Otherwise, I will cut off your heads.
* No, don't kill us. We will give you our crystal.
* (third crystal taken)


Act 4: The Snow Queen


Seeing a girl in her kingdom, she said: 


* Who are you, where are you from, and what do you need in my kingdom?
The girl froze and spoke to her: 


* I'm Hera and this is my dog ​​Lucky, I'm from Snowland, my father died and I'm looking for a means to resurrect my father.
* You are a kind girl, but you disturbed my peace. And for that, you will die slowly. But there is one thing: if you become my successor, I will forgive you and let you live and I will teach you my art to turn people into ice. You will stay here forever. What do you choose?


Choice:
Die slowly:
Hera became an ice statue.


Become her daughter:


And then a spirit arose and said:


* With this torch, you can turn the entire kingdom of the Snow Queen into water.


Hera put the torch into inventory. She was going to turn the entire kingdom, along with the queen, into water. The queen spoke:


* Girl, you are kind. You won't kill me, I didn't do you any harm. Perhaps you will leave me and my kingdom alone if I give you my magic crystal. You are kind, and not evil.


(fourth crystal taken)




Then the spirit appears and smiles slyly. 


* Well done girl, you were able to get what I could not get at the time. However, you don't know everything. 4 crystals are not enough to revive your father. I didn't tell you that I also have a crystal, which is the last component. Without this stone, you won't be able to revive your father. Only the power of five stones will give you what you want. But I was not going to give you my crystal, and I will not give it. And without my crystal, 4 crystals are worthless. Therefore, you have to give them to me.
* You deceived me, evil spirit. And I will not give you my crystals, which I have obtained.
* Then I will kill you and take them from you.
* Don't kill me and don't take my crystals from me. You are kind, helped me all the way through, and saved me from death.
* I had my agenda all along, and I helped you for a reason. I will become the most powerful being on earth and rule the world forever.
* Why do you need this power if it does not give you human and earthly happiness? Is this what happiness is? Rule the world and enslave the people. You don't even have friends.
Spirit thought:
* Yes indeed. I never had friends and no one ever offered me. That's why I became evil.
* Let's be friends then.
* Are you serious?
* Yes.
* Then I'll help you revive your father. But you don't need the stones anymore, and I'm leaving them for myself. I decided to abandon my goals to enslave the world and will help people.


Hera returns home with a magical flower. Putting the flower in her father's hand, she sees her father open his eyes.


End.
